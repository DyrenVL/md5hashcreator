Just a simple MD5 hash creator in Python, made by AI. Mainly 'made' it for my own personal use. I don't plan on making any further changes to it, mostly because I don't know any Python, and right now it just works.

Creates MD5 hashes for individual files located within a folder. Also creates a hash for the folder itself.
